# Live-Facial-Detection-and-Recognition

This repository contains a pattern recognition project focusing on facial recognition using deep neural networks (DNNs). The project integrates facial detection and recognition models to identify faces in real-time video streams.

## Features
- Facial Detection: Utilizes a pre-trained DNN model to detect faces in real-time video streams.
- Facial Recognition: Employs a pre-trained DNN model to recognize and label faces.
- Real-Time Processing: Processes video frames in real-time for face detection and recognition.

## File Structure
- Pattern_Recognition_Project.ipynb: Main Jupyter notebook containing the project code and explanations.
- nn4.small2.v1.t7: Pre-trained model for facial recognition.
- res10_300x300_ssd_iter_140000.caffemodel: Pre-trained model for facial detection.
- deploy.prototxt: Prototxt file for the facial detection model.
